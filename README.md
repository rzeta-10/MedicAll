## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/22f3003138/MedicAll.git
cd MedicAll
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the example below:

```env
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this
DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///hms.db
```

### 5. Initialize & Seed Database
The project comes with a migration script to set up the database and populate it with sample data (doctors, patients, appointments).

```bash
python migrations/migration.py
```
*This will create `hms.db` in the `instance/` folder and fill it with realistic test data.*

### 6. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
